  - ...
  - It's safer here...
  - ...
  - It's hard...
  - ...
  - It's so hard...
  - ...
  - It's so so hard...
  - ...
  - I can't...
  - ...
  - .....
  - .......
  - It's easier here...
  - ...
  - I know it might not be fine here\nbut it won't be different out there.
  - ...
  - I don't have to be judged here.
  - I don't have to be seen here.
  - I don't have to think here.
  - I don't have to think\nabout myself here....
  - ...
  - It's not healthy.\nI know.
  - But what am I\nsupposed to do?
  - Things seem so bleak for me...
  - All I have now is knowledge.
  - I know myself better than ever, but\nI still don't know what to do.
  - It's easier not to think\nor be expected anything.
  - It's easier to not be rejected...
  - ...
  - But how do you know?
  - I've tried already though...
  - More than once...
  - ...
  - How do you find such\nperserverence?
  - Perhaps our struggles\nare just different.
  - ...
  - I know there's\nothers like me...
  - I know they were\nable to get through it...
  - I'm not sure I have\ntheir courage, though.
  - Perhaps we just had different circumstances...
  - Being forced to take action instead of\nbeing allowed to retreat and hide.
  - Not everyone has a place to hide.
  - ...
  - I really am just a coward
  - and this is my self-made prison.
  - I'm sorry...
  - ...
  - It's so hard to believe...
  - to believe that things\ncould be different...
  - that things could be better...
  - I've tried to logic my way out of it.
  - You don't logic your way out of it.
  - I don't know what to do.
  - I really am just burning time...
  - ...
  - I don't have any better plan though.
  - Perhaps it's just fear.
  - Fear of the unknown.
  - Fear of change.
  - Fear of rejection.
  - Rejection...
  - That's definitely a big part of it...
  - And I even did try and got hit hard with it...
  - Rejection...
  - Each word lingers still, after all this time...
  - And I can't even pretend like it was\njust one person either...
  - I can't even pretend\nthat it didn't suck...
  - ...
  - I don't know how other's can do it...
  - How other's can be so brave...
  - Perhaps it's foolhardiness...
  - ...
  - They definitely see\nsomething I don't...
  - A way to escape\nthis pit...
  - A way to escape\nthis self hate...
  - A way to escape\nthis stagnation...
  - A way to escape this\nself imposed neglect...
  - A way to escape\nthis suffering...
  - And live...
  - ...
  - If only things were easier.
  - This pit may be killing me, but anything\nelse seems like climbing a mountain.
  - It's easier to lose one self.
  - It's a pretty conveniant way to cope...
  - But the pain never seems to go away.
  - You just forget it's there.
  - Until one day you're sitting there\nwatching yourself cry.
  - And you're not there.
  - You don't even know why you're crying.
  - You didn't know anything was\nbothering you that much.
  - It's festered and you weren't even looking.
  - And now you've ripped\nthe wheel from yourself
  - and don't even know how to get\nback on track.
  - It takes a lot of time and thought...
  - before you can see yourself again...
  - and then when you finally\nunderstand yourself
  - better than you ever had before
  - BOOM
  - everyone seems ready to crawl\nout of the woodwork
  - to tell you how you don't know yourself.
  - The irony of that statement...
  - So many people...
  - ...
  - and then...
  - when things get...
  - dark
  - when it really seems like the end...
  - and there's almost no one around.
  - everyone who said you were wrong
  - and that they were worried about you
  - isn't there when they should be worrying.
  - ...
  - but weirdly enough...
  - The world can be pretty cruel.
  - You find someone who is there for\nyou in that moment.
  - It's not enough to make everything\nsunshine and rainbows
  - but you're not alone.
  - ...
  - It still feels so lonely though...
  - It's enough to not stop the train,
  - but it still isn't enough to leave the room.
  - ...
  - Why isn't it enough?
  - Why...
  - Why.....
  - ...
  - Maybe I should just\nlay back down...
  - Why...
